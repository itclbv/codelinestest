# Refactoring Kata

This Kata is based on the Gilded Rose Kata, originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/13/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/) and [this version with multiple languages](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. 
Instructions can be found in the GildedRoseRequirements document.


Have fun and good luck!
